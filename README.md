There are many aspects considered when choosing a hotel. The main idea is to find the appropriate prediction model for predicting hotel booking cancellations which finds the finest explaining variables for customer cancellations. This Hotel Booking Cancellation model can be useful not only for the vacationer but for the hotels’ owners.

## Details of Dataset
1. hotel :(H1 = Resort Hotel or H2 = City Hotel).
2. is_canceled Value: showing if the booking had been cancelled (1) or not (0).
3. lead_time: Number of days that elapsed between the entering date of the booking into the PMS and the arrival date.
4. arrival_date_year: Year of arrival date.
5. arrival_date_month: The months in which guests are coming.
6. arrival_date_week_number: Week number of year for arrival date.
7. arrival_date_day_of_month: Which day of the months guest is arriving.
8. stays_in_weekend_nights: Number of weekend stay at night (Saturday or Sunday) the guest stayed or booked to stay at the hotel.
9. stays_in_week_nights: Number of weekdays stay at night (Monday to Friday) in the hotel.

11. children: Number of children.
12. babies: Number of babies.
13. meal: Type of meal booked.
14. country: Country of origin.
15. market_segment: Through which channel hotels were booked.

19. previous_bookings_not_canceled: Show if the repeated guest has not cancelled the booking before.
20. reserved_room_type: Code of room type reserved. Code is presented instead of designation for anonymity reasons.
